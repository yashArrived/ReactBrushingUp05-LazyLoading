# ReactBrushingUp05-LazyLoading



LazyLoading or chunking is a web development technique that delays the loading of certain resources on a page until they are needed, such as when a user interacts with the page. This can improve page load times, reduce bandwidth usage, and improve the user experience. 
 
 Here are some benefits of lazy loading: 
 
  > Faster page load times: Lazy loading reduces the length of the 
  > critical rendering path, which can shorten the time it takes for 
  > a page to load. 
 
> Reduced bandwidth usage: Lazy loading can reduce the amount of bandwidth used by a website. 
 
> Improved user experience: Lazy loading can improve the user experience by making content immediately visible to users. 
 
> Better SEO performance: Lazy loading can improve a website's SEO performance. 
 
> Shrinking the initial size of a website: Lazy loading can reduce the initial size of a website.
